# BGB_MVC
My First REAL go at a .Net MVC web application using EntityFrameWork.  
I have worked through  Pro MVC 5 Sports Store and Microsofts.   


Board Game Collection App  
Basic Idea:  
Users Login, add Titles to game Library and manage collection.  

Data Model  
  -Game: board game titles & properties  
  -User: User Name & ICollection<Collections>  
  -Collection: User ID and Game ID  


***To Do***  
visual pollish  
null-able game properties  
Collection CRUD edits  
***Basic Features Fully Functionalable***  

***STOP No More***
***Switch from Local Db, Publish Online v1.0***  
***Learn more Git branches? Switch back to LocalDB, continue working***
